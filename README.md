# Better YouTube Shorts
YouTube Shorts have a terrible UI that forces users to view videos without any playback controls.
This Chrome extension simply redirects a shorts URL to the normal YouTube URL. 

Not currently available on the Chrome Extensions Store, but can be added to Chrome with developer mode.
 
# Installing
 Adding the extension to Chrome (developer mode)
 1. Clone the project
 2. Open chrome extensions manager (go to url [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/))
 3. Toggle developer mode (top right of window)
 4. "Load Unpacked" and selected the /src folder
